# subscription-app

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node ^4.2.3, npm ^2.14.7
- [Bower](bower.io) (`npm install --global bower`)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and then `gem install sass`
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (`npm install --global grunt-cli`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.

3. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

4. Run `grunt serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run all the tests.

- `grunt test:client` will run frontend tests only (default browser option: `Chrome`).
- `grunt test:server` will run backend tests only.

## Framework libraries

### Frontend

Built using `AngularJS` and `Bootstrap`.

Some relevant libraries used:

- [angular-autodisable](https://github.com/kirstein/angular-autodisable): An extension to angular `ng-click` directive that automatically sets the element to disabled if the handler would return a promise. **Why:** It is a very useful directive you can easily use on forms to automatically avoid multiple submitting.

- [restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular): An AngularJS service that simplifies common GET, POST, DELETE, and UPDATE requests with a minimum of client code. **Why:** It is a very simple way to consume data from a RESTful API and it also allows to do some interesting things like creating several instances with different configurations or adding request/response interceptors (which are basically automatic actions to perform on every request/response automatically), among others.

### Backend

Built using `Node.js` and `MongoDB` as persistance.

Some relevant libraries used:

- [express](http://expressjs.com): A minimal and flexible `Node.js` web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications with a large number of HTTP utility methods and middleware that turns creating an API into something fast and easy. **Why:** It is one of the most straightforward framework choices for developing APIs in `Node.js`, with a big community behind it. There are also a lot of useful middleware out there - for example: authentication or security middleware - that can be easily plugged in your express app with no effort.

- [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose): A `MongoDB` object modeling for `Node.js` that provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. **Why:** It makes `MongoDB` data modeling and validation easier because it includes built-in query building, validation, type casting and some other useful features that, in the end, allow to simplify code and save development time.

- [throwjs](https://github.com/kbariotis/throw.js/): A very simple HTTP Error collection library. **Why:** It is very handy because it allows to create HTTP Error objects through a very simple and intuitive API that also simplifies and keeps code neat and clean - plus saves development time too!

- [node-http-status](https://github.com/prettymuchbryce/node-http-status): Very simple module that exports constants enumerating the HTTP status codes. **Why:** Its very useful to avoid having status codes written in number on your server code and having them easily referenced by constants which keeps code much clean and readable. This one, together with the above listed `throwjs`, is one of my favorites.

Some **security** relevant libraries used:

- [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet): Helmet is a collection of 12 smaller middleware functions that set HTTP headers to help protect your app. **Why:** Because it can help to avoid some known web vulnerabilities - see the Express Security Best Practices [docs](http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html#use-helmet).
